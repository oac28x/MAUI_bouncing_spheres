# MAUI_bouncing_spheres
Just sharing a animation I've just created two bouncing spheres. One sphere paints its path with orange, while the other erases the path as it moves, creating an endless random/loop of creativity and renewal. Both spheres are contained within a larger sphere, representing the balance between creation and destruction within a defined space.
